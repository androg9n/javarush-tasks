# Client-Server Chat Application - JavaMultithreading Course Project

This repository contains a client-server chat application developed as part of the JavaMultithreading course on JavaRush. The project includes several components:

- **Server**: Manages text message exchanges between clients.
- **Console Client**: Connects to the server and enables message exchange with other participants.
- **Bot Client**: Responds to requests by providing the current date and time.
- **GUI Client**: A chat client with a graphical user interface.

- Working with **sockets** for network communication.
- Using **serialization** and **deserialization** for data exchange.
- Developing **multithreaded** applications, synchronizing threads, using the `volatile modifier`, and utilizing classes from `java.util.concurrent`.
- Implementing the **MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern**.
- Using **inner** and **nested** classes in Java.
