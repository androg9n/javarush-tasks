# 2048 Game - JavaMultithreading Course Project

This repository contains my implementation of the 2048 game, developed as part of the JavaMultithreading course on JavaRush.

In addition to the core game functionality, I implemented two extra features:

- **Undo Last Move**: Allows the player to revert their last move.
- **Automatic Best Move**: Calculates and selects the optimal move by evaluating the effectiveness of each possible action.
